###### Introduction  
Biofeedback systems that use electromagnetic (EM) waves for diagnostics and treatment represent a convergence of physics and biology. These devices aim to read the body’s subtle electromagnetic signals, interpret them for signs of imbalance or disease, and deliver corrective frequency-based therapies. This review explores the historical foundations, theoretical physics principles, and modern applications of biofeedback technologies such as SCIO and Metatron.

### 1. Historical Foundations of Electromagnetic Biofeedback  

#### 1.1. Cartan’s Field Theory and Torsion Fields  
In 1922, **Élie Cartan** extended Einstein’s general relativity by introducing *affine torsion* of spacetime, leading to the **Einstein–Cartan theory**. Soviet physicists, particularly **Nikolai Kozyrev**, later expanded on torsion field theories, claiming that torsion waves could carry biological information with minimal loss. This concept influenced later alternative medicine devices, which assert that biological systems emit and respond to torsion/spin fields as part of their electromagnetic profile.

#### 1.2. Soviet Research in Nonlinear Systems (NLS) Diagnostics  
During the Cold War, the USSR invested heavily in research linking physics with biology. By the 1970s, **Svyatoslav P. Nesterov** led research into how torsion fields might influence biological and mental processes. By 1988, he developed the concept of **Nonlinear Diagnostics Systems (NLS)**, a method for scanning the body’s biofield to detect abnormalities. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Nesterov founded the **Institute of Practical Psychophysics (IPP)** in Omsk, Russia, which developed the Metatron system. These devices analyze deviations in the body’s electromagnetic signals using nonlinear mathematics to detect early-stage diseases.

#### 1.3. Thomas J. Goodwin and NASA’s Frequency Research  
At NASA, **Dr. Thomas J. Goodwin** investigated how electromagnetic waves could stimulate cellular regeneration. His 2003 study found that **pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) at 10 Hz accelerated nerve tissue repair by 2.5 to 4 times**. NASA later developed devices for astronauts using PEMF to mitigate muscle and bone loss in microgravity. Goodwin’s research provided a scientific basis for frequency-based biofeedback therapies.

#### 1.4. Royal Rife’s Frequency Experiments for Cancer  
In the 1930s, **Dr. Royal Raymond Rife** built powerful optical microscopes and hypothesized that each pathogen had a unique **mortal oscillatory rate**. Using radiofrequency waves, Rife claimed to selectively destroy microbes in living tissue. In the 1930s, a clinical trial reportedly treated cancer patients with Rife’s frequency instrument. However, mainstream science later rejected his claims due to a lack of reproducible results, and Rife’s work fell into obscurity. Despite this, his ideas inspired later research into frequency-specific therapies.

### 2. Theoretical and Technical Mechanisms  

##### 2.1. Quantum Entanglement and “Action-at-a-Distance” Claims  
Quantum entanglement—where particles share a linked quantum state—has been investigated in medical imaging (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography with entangled photons). Some biofeedback devices claim to use quantum entanglement to remotely diagnose a person through a DNA sample or even just their name. While true entanglement does not persist in macroscopic biological systems, this concept is frequently invoked in alternative medicine.

##### 2.2. Biophoton Emissions and Cellular Electromagnetic Communication  
Biophotons, ultra-weak light emissions from cells, were first systematically studied by **Fritz-Albert Popp** in the 1970s. Research suggests that biophotons might serve as a cellular communication network. Studies have shown that stressed cells emit more photons, and some researchers hypothesize that biophoton coherence influences health. Biofeedback devices like **gas discharge visualization (GDV) cameras** aim to capture these emissions as indicators of physiological state.

##### 2.3. Nonlinear Systems Theory in Diagnostics  
Biological systems exhibit **nonlinear dynamics**, meaning that their responses are complex and adaptive rather than linear. For example, **heart rate variability (HRV)** analysis reveals that a loss of chaotic variability in heartbeat intervals correlates with disease. Advanced biofeedback devices incorporate **chaos analysis algorithms** to detect subtle physiological imbalances. Metatron NLS uses **spectral pattern recognition** to match a patient’s electromagnetic signature to known disease states.

#### 2.4. Frequency-Based Therapies and Effects on Cells/Pathogens  
Recent research supports the idea that specific EM frequencies influence biological systems. **Dr. Boris Pasche** demonstrated that **amplitude-modulated radiofrequencies at tumor-specific frequencies** could block cancer cell proliferation without harming healthy cells. Similar research has shown that EM waves can influence microbial growth and brain function. **Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)** and **low-intensity RF therapy** are examples of mainstream applications of frequency-based medicine.

### 3. Modern Applications and Biofeedback Devices  

#### 3.1. SCIO Quantum Biofeedback System  
Developed by **Bill Nelson**, SCIO (Scientific Consciousness Interface Operation system) is a biofeedback device that measures a patient’s **electrodermal responses** to multiple frequencies and then provides corrective frequency therapy. The system integrates principles from acupuncture meridian theory and quantum physics analogies. While widely used in alternative medicine, scientific validation remains limited.

#### 3.2. Metatron NLS and the Institute of Practical Psychophysics  
The **Metatron NLS system**, developed by the Russian **Institute of Practical Psychophysics (IPP)**, is an **advanced bioresonance scanner**. It detects electromagnetic oscillations from organs and compares them to a vast database of pathological frequency patterns. The device has received **Class IIa CE medical approval in Europe** and claims to detect early-stage diseases before symptoms appear. However, independent validation is needed.

#### 3.3. Other Modern Devices and Modalities  
- **Qest4 system**: A handplate-electrode bioenergetic testing device similar to SCIO.
- **Bioresonance therapy (BICOM, Sensitiv Imago)**: Uses inverted frequency patterns to neutralize pathological signals.
- **Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy**: FDA-approved for bone growth stimulation and pain management.
- **GDV cameras**: Measure biophoton emissions and claim to visualize “energy fields.”

### Conclusion  
Biofeedback systems using electromagnetic waves are rooted in physics concepts—torsion fields, quantum mechanics, biophotonics, and nonlinear dynamics. Devices like SCIO and Metatron offer a non-invasive way to analyze and correct the body’s electromagnetic state. While mainstream medicine remains skeptical, research into **frequency-based cancer therapy, neurostimulation, and quantum-enhanced imaging** suggests that certain applications have real potential. More peer-reviewed studies are needed to validate and refine these technologies, bridging the gap between alternative biofeedback and evidence-based medicine.
