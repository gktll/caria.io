Core Principles of Clean Code:
Readability and Expressiveness: Code should be written in a clear and understandable way, using meaningful names and a logical structure. 
Simplicity: Code should be as simple as possible without sacrificing functionality. Avoid unnecessary complexity and strive for straightforward solutions. 
Modularity: Break down complex tasks into smaller, well-defined functions or modules. 
Testability: Clean code is designed to be easily testable, with minimal side effects. 
Avoid Duplication (DRY): Don't repeat the same logic in multiple places. Use functions or other techniques to reuse code. 
Comments: Use comments to explain the "why" behind the code, not the "what". Code should be self-documenting as much as possible. 
Consistency: Adhere to coding conventions and maintain a consistent style throughout the codebase. 
Remove Dead Code: Delete commented-out code and unused variables. 
Single Responsibility: Each function or class should have a single, well-defined purpose.
