###### Introduction
My fascination with this topic stems from firsthand experience. I’ve extensively experimented with various NLS or Non-Linear System (diagnostic) devices, witnessing results that defy conventional explanations. Quetse macchine non sono ancora di uso comune, ma si ritiene che lo saranno.  Immagina di andare dal dottore e questo invece di fare le solite domande ti mettesse un paio di cuffie, lanciasse un programma, e ti dicesse il problema per cui sei venuto. 

A typical session unfolds like this:

- The patient lies on a treatment bed.
- They put on headphones or a leather band (likely containing a solenoid).
- The therapist scans their body using specialized software.
- The software pinpoints sensitive areas and initiates corrective measures.

Suffering from chronic pain—muscle tension so intense it can be debilitating—I often know the affected area before the therapist even begins. Sometimes some pain pops up during the therapy. I just need to tell him. He acknowledges, then nonchalantly says, “Wait a moment” (implying he’s launching the corresponding program). A few minutes later, the pain is gone.

### 1. Spooky action at Distance
After years of weekly sessions, testing different settings and configurations, I still struggle to rationalize how these devices operate at a distance. The term Spukhafte Fernwirkung—"spooky action at a distance"—was coined by Einstein to describe quantum entanglement, a concept some of you might already be familiar with.
It’s easy to fall into the trap of citing entanglement equations and quantum mechanics jargon, but that’s not my goal. Those truly invested in the subject can dive into specialized journals. After all, quantum physics is old news.
What’s unsettling is that these machines claim to heal remotely, basing this extraordinary assertion on quantum entanglement. According to their logic, just as some believe experienced magnetotherapists can work at a distance, these devices can do the same. All they need is a recent photograph of the patient, a fingernail clipping (rich in DNA), or a blood sample. No matter where the therapist or patient is located, the software purportedly diagnoses and treats ailments through frequency transmission.

### 2. Yet pain disappear
Trying to extract clear information from manufacturers is a futile exercise. Their communication is cryptic at best, evasive at worst. Their websites—ostensibly designed to provide scientific insight—are bizarre, if not outright dubious. The patient, even the therapist, is left in a black box. Yet, here’s the undeniable part: after five minutes, the pain disappears. It’s mind-boggling. No amount of digging through scientific literature yields validation—there are simply no studies. No results, no peer-reviewed data, nothing—even under biofeedback, which is the closest legitimate field recognized by the FDA. And yet, these machines diagnose. They know if the pterygoid muscle is inflamed compared to the deep masseter. They pinpoint exactly which tooth has decay—and to what degree. They can identify which pathogens are wreaking havoc in the gut. They even make psychological inferences. After treatment, you don’t just feel pain-free—you feel younger, lighter, more balanced. So much so that skipping a session makes a tangible difference. The real enigma here isn’t quantum entanglement. It isn’t Schrödinger’s paradox. The true absurdity is this: the entire field remains unprofessional, to put it mildly—not even because skeptics dismiss it, but because even its own creators somehow seems to refuse to treat it seriously.
