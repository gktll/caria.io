## Introduction
Sleep paralysis (SP) has been interpreted in numerous ways across cultures. While medical science explains it as a sleep disorder, many traditions see it as **spiritual attack**, **possession**, or **encounters with supernatural entities**. Folklore describes SP as a **nightmare spirit pressing on the sleeper**, while esoteric traditions speak of **astral parasites ("larvae")** or demonic entities draining one's energy. This review explores global interpretations, causes, and protective measures against SP.

### 1. Cultural Interpretations

#### 1.1. European Folklore
- **"Nightmare" or "Mare"**: In medieval Europe, SP was believed to be caused by a demon or witch sitting on the sleeper’s chest [[30](#30)].
- **Incubi and Succubi**: Demonic entities that sexually attack victims during sleep.
- **The "Old Hag"**: In Newfoundland, sufferers describe an old woman crouching on their chest, preventing movement [[28](#28)].

#### 1.2. Middle Eastern and Islamic Views
- **Jinn (جن)**: Islamic traditions describe SP as an attack by malevolent jinn, pressing on the sleeper and sometimes attempting possession [[31](#31)].
- **Shaitan (شيطان) Influence**: Some believe demonic forces target those who fail to pray before sleep.

#### 1.3. African and Afro-Caribbean Beliefs
- **Ogun Oru (Nigeria)**: A nocturnal battle between a sleeper’s earthly and spiritual spouses, causing SP [[34](#34)].
- **Haitian Voodoo**: Some interpret SP as "soul capture" by spirits or vengeful ancestors.

#### 1.4. Asian and Indigenous Traditions
- **Kanashibari (Japan, China)**: "Bound by metal"—believed to be a ghost or curse preventing movement [[23](#23)].
- **Phi Am (Thailand)**: Ghosts attacking sleepers, particularly those sleeping on their backs.
- **Uqumangirniq (Inuit)**: Shamans describe SP as a spirit-induced dream paralysis [[9](#9)].

### 2. Esoteric Perspectives: "Larvae" and Astral Parasites

#### 2.1. Occult and Theosophical Views
- **Theosophy**: Helena Blavatsky described astral "larvae"—energy-draining entities lingering in the astral realm [[43](#43)].
- **Gnosticism**: Certain esoteric schools believe SP is caused by "astral vampires" feeding off human energy [[49](#49)].
- **Kabbalah & Hermeticism**: SP entities are seen as "Qliphoth" (demonic husks) clinging to weak auras [[74](#74)].

### 3. Causes and Symptoms According to Esoteric and Folk Traditions

- **Sleep Position**: Many cultures warn against sleeping **on one’s back**, believing it invites attacks.
- **Spiritual Weakness**: Failure to perform protective prayers or rituals leaves individuals vulnerable.
- **Sorcery and Curses**: Inuit and Japanese traditions suggest shamans or witches can send paralysis spells [[23](#23)].
- **Energy Drain and Psychic Attack**: Esoteric teachings claim "larvae" attach to the aura and induce SP to feed on fear.

### 4. Protection and Remedies

#### 4.1. Religious Protections
- **Islam**: Reciting **Ayat al-Kursi** or Quranic verses repels jinn [[31](#31)].
- **Christianity**: Keeping a **Bible or crucifix** near the bed wards off incubi.
- **Judaism**: Incantation bowls and Kabbalistic amulets were historically used to stop Lilith from attacking sleepers [[74](#74)].

#### 4.2. Folk Magic and Rituals
- **Protective Herbs**: Garlic, salt, and sage are used in various cultures to repel spirits.
- **Iron Objects**: In Europe, placing iron (scissors, nails) under the bed deters supernatural forces.
- **Turning the Pillow**: In Japanese folklore, flipping the pillow confuses spirits and stops paralysis.

#### 4.3. Esoteric Practices
- **Astral Protection Techniques**: Meditation and visualization of **white light shields** are common in Theosophy and New Age practices.
- **Banishing Rituals**: Burning **frankincense, sulfur, or sage** is believed to remove astral parasites [[49](#49)].
- **Lucid Dreaming Techniques**: Some occultists suggest training in lucid dreaming to resist SP entities and fight back.

### 5. Comparative Analysis
Despite cultural differences, **the core themes of SP experiences remain consistent** worldwide. Nearly all traditions describe:
1. **A malevolent presence pressing on the sleeper** (witches, demons, ghosts, jinn).
2. **A feeling of suffocation or weight on the chest**.
3. **A belief that protective rituals, prayers, or objects can prevent attacks**.

While modern medicine attributes SP to REM dysfunction, cultural and esoteric traditions maintain that the experience has **spiritual significance**, whether as a psychic attack, soul disturbance, or doorway to the astral realm.
