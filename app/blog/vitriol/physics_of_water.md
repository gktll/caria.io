There is a considerable delay with which some of the latest theories in physics impact the common thinking.
After the idea of objectivity is gone, spacetime manifold is gone too, scientists are looking for more useful frameworks to understand reality.
It is clear that the physics as the science of the mineral world could adapr artificial constructs to the artifical world it put at the centre of the study, however, once [...] turns out that space and time are not only useless when [...] but are bottleneck.
It is clear that the the next physics will likely heavy rely on a sort of expanded physics of the water, I mean expanded cause it would need to be revised in order to fit the sort of invisible jelly where the material world is immersed. 
Matter floats in a placenta-like invisibe substance which reminds of a liquid when one looks at it. Many other animate objects float in there, some of them are animal like and move in a swimming fashion. It would be interesting to see if the condensation of energy that solidy in matter progressively faint in an aura like fashion, and to waht extent the biophotons can represent a sort of visualization of this process. 
I first started thinking about the ether theories, Maxwell was the one who studied ...
